      <p>
        I want you to stay<br/>
        Till I'm in the grave<br/>
        Till I rot away, dead and buried<br/>
        Till I'm in the casket you carry<br/><br/>

        If you go, I'm going too, uh<br/>
        'Cause it was always you, alright<br/>
        And if I'm turning blue, please, don't save me<br/>
        Nothing left to lose without my baby<br/><br/>

        Birds of a feather, we should stick together<br/>
        I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone<br/>
        Can't change the weather, might not be forever<br/>
        But if it's forever, it's even better<br/><br/>

        And I don't know what I'm crying for<br/>
        I don't think I could love you more<br/>
        It might not be long, but, baby, I<br/><br/>

        I'll love you till the day that I die<br/><br/>
        Till the day that I die<br/>
        Till the light leaves my eyes<br/>
        Till the day that I die<br/><br/>

        I want you to see, mmm<br/>
        How you look to me, huh<br/>
        You wouldn't believe if I told ya<br/>
        You would keep the compliments I throw ya<br/><br/>

        But you're so full of shit, hmm<br/>
        Tell me it's a bit, oh<br/>
        Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted<br/>
        Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid<br/><br/>

        And I don't know what I'm crying for<br/>
        I don't think I could love you more<br/>
        It might not be long, but, baby, I<br/>
        Don't wanna say goodbye<br/><br/>

        (Birds of a feather, we should stick together) till the day that I die<br/>
        (I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone) till the light leaves my eyes<br/>
        (Can't change the weather, might not be forever) till the day that I die<br/>
        But if it's forever, it's even better<br/><br/>

        I knew you in another life<br/>
        You had the same look in your eyes<br/>
        I love you, don't act so surprised<br/>
